Briefly, each sample was amplified in triplicate, combined, and cleaned using the MO BIO 96 htp PCR clean up kit. PCR reactions contained 13 uL MO BIO PCR water, 10 uL 5 Prime Hot Master Mix, 0.5 uL each of the forward and reverse primers (10 uM final concentration), and 1.0 uL genomic DNA. Reactions were held at 94C for 3 min to denature the DNA, with amplification proceeding for 35 cycles at 94C for 45s, 50C for 60s, and 72C for 90s; a final extension of 10 min at 72 C was added to ensure complete amplification. Cleaned amplicons were quantified using Picogreen dsDNA reagent in 10 mM Tris buffer (pH 8.0). A composite sample for se- quencing was created by combining equimolar ratios of amplicons from the individual samples, followed by gel purification and ethanol precipitation to remove any remaining contaminants and PCR artifacts. The sample, along with aliquots of the three sequencing primers, was sent to Illumina for sequencing.	40.0149856	0	CCME	CaporasoIlluminaPNAS2011_5prime

Briefly, each sample was amplified in triplicate, combined, and cleaned using the MO BIO 96 htp PCR clean up kit. PCR reactions contained 13 uL MO BIO PCR water, 10 uL 5 Prime Hot Master Mix, 0.5 uL each of the forward and reverse primers (10 uM final concentration), and 1.0 uL genomic DNA. Reactions were held at 94C for 3 min to denature the DNA, with amplification proceeding for 35 cycles at 94C for 45s, 50C for 60s, and 72C for 90s; a final extension of 10 min at 72 C was added to ensure complete amplification. Cleaned amplicons were quantified using Picogreen dsDNA reagent in 10 mM Tris buffer (pH 8.0). A composite sample for se- quencing was created by combining equimolar ratios of amplicons from the individual samples, followed by gel purification and ethanol precipitation to remove any remaining contaminants and PCR artifacts. The sample, along with aliquots of the three sequencing primers, was sent to Illumina for sequencing.	32.5510187	0	CCME	CaporasoIlluminaPNAS2011_5prime

Briefly, each sample was amplified in triplicate, combined, and cleaned using the MO BIO 96 htp PCR clean up kit. PCR reactions contained 13 uL MO BIO PCR water, 10 uL 5 Prime Hot Master Mix, 0.5 uL each of the forward and reverse primers (10 uM final concentration), and 1.0 uL genomic DNA. Reactions were held at 94C for 3 min to denature the DNA, with amplification proceeding for 35 cycles at 94C for 45s, 50C for 60s, and 72C for 90s; a final extension of 10 min at 72 C was added to ensure complete amplification. Cleaned amplicons were quantified using Picogreen dsDNA reagent in 10 mM Tris buffer (pH 8.0). A composite sample for se- quencing was created by combining equimolar ratios of amplicons from the individual samples, followed by gel purification and ethanol precipitation to remove any remaining contaminants and PCR artifacts. The sample, along with aliquots of the three sequencing primers, was sent to Illumina for sequencing.	33.6069147	0	CCME	CaporasoIlluminaPNAS2011_5prime

Briefly, each sample was amplified in triplicate, combined, and cleaned using the MO BIO 96 htp PCR clean up kit. PCR reactions contained 13 uL MO BIO PCR water, 10 uL 5 Prime Hot Master Mix, 0.5 uL each of the forward and reverse primers (10 uM final concentration), and 1.0 uL genomic DNA. Reactions were held at 94C for 3 min to denature the DNA, with amplification proceeding for 35 cycles at 94C for 45s, 50C for 60s, and 72C for 90s; a final extension of 10 min at 72 C was added to ensure complete amplification. Cleaned amplicons were quantified using Picogreen dsDNA reagent in 10 mM Tris buffer (pH 8.0). A composite sample for se- quencing was created by combining equimolar ratios of amplicons from the individual samples, followed by gel purification and ethanol precipitation to remove any remaining contaminants and PCR artifacts. The sample, along with aliquots of the three sequencing primers, was sent to Illumina for sequencing.	46.0382839	0	CCME	CaporasoIlluminaPNAS2011_5prime

Briefly, each sample was amplified in triplicate, combined, and cleaned using the MO BIO 96 htp PCR clean up kit. PCR reactions contained 13 uL MO BIO PCR water, 10 uL 5 Prime Hot Master Mix, 0.5 uL each of the forward and reverse primers (10 uM final concentration), and 1.0 uL genomic DNA. Reactions were held at 94C for 3 min to denature the DNA, with amplification proceeding for 35 cycles at 94C for 45s, 50C for 60s, and 72C for 90s; a final extension of 10 min at 72 C was added to ensure complete amplification. Cleaned amplicons were quantified using Picogreen dsDNA reagent in 10 mM Tris buffer (pH 8.0). A composite sample for se- quencing was created by combining equimolar ratios of amplicons from the individual samples, followed by gel purification and ethanol precipitation to remove any remaining contaminants and PCR artifacts.

Briefly, each sample was amplified in triplicate, combined, and cleaned using the MO BIO 96 htp PCR clean up kit. PCR reactions contained 13 uL MO BIO PCR water, 10 uL 5 Prime Hot Master Mix, 0.5 uL each of the forward and reverse primers (10 uM final concentration), and 1.0 uL genomic DNA. Reactions were held at 94C for 3 min to denature the DNA, with amplification proceeding for 35 cycles at 94C for 45s, 50C for 60s, and 72C for 90s; a final extension of 10 min at 72 C was added to ensure complete amplification. Cleaned amplicons were quantified using Picogreen dsDNA reagent in 10 mM Tris buffer (pH 8.0). A composite sample for se- quencing was created by combining equimolar ratios of amplicons from the individual samples, followed by gel purification and ethanol precipitation to remove any remaining contaminants and PCR artifacts. The sample, along with aliquots of the three sequencing primers, was sent to Illumina for sequencing.	33.6738638	0	CCME	CaporasoIlluminaPNAS2011_5prime

Briefly, each sample was amplified in triplicate, combined, and cleaned using the MO BIO 96 htp PCR clean up kit. PCR reactions contained 13 uL MO BIO PCR water, 10 uL 5 Prime Hot Master Mix, 0.5 uL each of the forward and reverse primers (10 uM final concentration), and 1.0 uL genomic DNA. Reactions were held at 94C for 3 min to denature the DNA, with amplification proceeding for 35 cycles at 94C for 45s, 50C for 60s, and 72C for 90s; a final extension of 10 min at 72 C was added to ensure complete amplification. Cleaned amplicons were quantified using Picogreen dsDNA reagent in 10 mM Tris buffer (pH 8.0). A composite sample for se- quencing was created by combining equimolar ratios of amplicons from the individual samples, followed by gel purification and ethanol precipitation to remove any remaining contaminants and PCR artifacts. The sample, along with aliquots of the three sequencing primers, was sent to Illumina for sequencing.	31.7122351	0	CCME	CaporasoIlluminaPNAS2011_5prime

Briefly, each sample was amplified in triplicate, combined, and cleaned using the MO BIO 96 htp PCR clean up kit. PCR reactions contained 13 uL MO BIO PCR water, 10 uL 5 Prime Hot Master Mix, 0.5 uL each of the forward and reverse primers (10 uM final concentration), and 1.0 uL genomic DNA. Reactions were held at 94C for 3 min to denature the DNA, with amplification proceeding for 35 cycles at 94C for 45s, 50C for 60s, and 72C for 90s; a final extension of 10 min at 72 C was added to ensure complete amplification. Cleaned amplicons were quantified using Picogreen dsDNA reagent in 10 mM Tris buffer (pH 8.0). A composite sample for se- quencing was created by combining equimolar ratios of amplicons from the individual samples, followed by gel purification and ethanol precipitation to remove any remaining contaminants and PCR artifacts. The sample, along with aliquots of the three sequencing primers, was sent to Illumina for sequencing.	33.6069147	0	CCME	CaporasoIlluminaPNAS2011_5prime

Briefly, each sample was amplified in triplicate, combined, and cleaned using the MO BIO 96 htp PCR clean up kit. PCR reactions contained 13 uL MO BIO PCR water, 10 uL 5 Prime Hot Master Mix, 0.5 uL each of the forward and reverse primers (10 uM final concentration), and 1.0 uL genomic DNA. Reactions were held at 94C for 3 min to denature the DNA, with amplification proceeding for 35 cycles at 94C for 45s, 50C for 60s, and 72C for 90s; a final extension of 10 min at 72 C was added to ensure complete amplification. Cleaned amplicons were quantified using Picogreen dsDNA reagent in 10 mM Tris buffer (pH 8.0).
